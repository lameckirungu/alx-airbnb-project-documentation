# User Stories Documentation
This directory contains the user stories for the AirBnB Clone Backend project.

## Objective
The purpose of this documentation is to translate the technical interactions from the **Use Case Diagram** into human-centric **User Stories**.

These stories follow the standard format:
***As a [Role], I want to [Goal/Action], so that [Benefit/Motivation]***.

This approach helps the development team understand the value of each feature from a user's perspective, guiding the implementation and testing process.

## User Stories
All user stories are documented in the following file:
* [**`user-stories.md`**](./user-stories.md)
